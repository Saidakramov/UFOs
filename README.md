# UFOs

## Overview of Project:
- Our objectives were to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria simultaneously. In addition to the date, we added table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Results: 
- We improved our website by providing four additional filters for users to input, which made our search terms more user-friendly and easily accessible.

- As we see below, we can easily search for information by one of the filters that sorts by shape. When we enter "circle," the data shows only four instances of recording UFOs with a circle shape.

- Another great filter, "Country," can provide information about UFO sightings in different countries. We searched for Canada and found that there are only two records of UFO appearance.
