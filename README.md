# UFOs

## Overview of Project:
- Our objectives were to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria simultaneously. In addition to the date, we added table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Results: 
- We improved our website by providing four additional filters for users to input, which made our search terms more user-friendly and easily accessible.

- As we see below, we can easily search for information by one of the filters that sorts by shape. When we enter "circle," the data shows only four instances of recording UFOs with a circle shape.

- Another great filter, "Country," can provide information about UFO sightings in different countries. We searched for Canada and found that there are only two records of UFO appearance.

## Summary: 

- This design might work well, but there is a drawback. If the user is unfamiliar with the data, such as knowing specific dates and shapes of the UFOs, it could be hard to navigate through a web application. 

- To fix that issue, we could improve our web application with drop-down menus showing all the possible selections for each filter. For example: if the user wants to filter using the "Enter the shape" section, that filter can display all the known shapes, and the user can pick one and receive information accordingly.

- Another improvement we can imply is the case insensitivity. The current program detects only the exact combination of letters. To search for the city Benton, we must type "benton," but if we type "Benton," it won't show any results even though it is the same city.
